# fastRecursiveFibonacciSequence
The purpose of this project was to implement a fast recursive Fibonacci sequence algorithm to compute the nth Fibonacci number using the concept of memory to store previous computed values using an array. The goal was to be able to compute the 5000th Fibonacci number quickly. The solution I found to work fastest was to use the BigInteger class included in java.math.* as it allowed for the computation of large number such as the Fibonacci number of 5000. I created an array with size of 10000 with the type BigInteger to store the answers of the nth Fibonacci number. This array stored the Fibonacci number of value n in index n to allow for easy key look up alike to a hash map but simpler since just an array was employed. In the end I found that making the array static and final optimized the algorithm for speed. Then inside the fib(int n) method, I had a base case for the recursion that if n was 1 or 2 the answer was 1 and then I checked if the Fibonacci number of n was already computed and if it was then it returned that value from the array, if not it continued to check if n-1 and n-2 was already computed and if so, it used those values to compute n, and if not it went to the recursive call of the method fib to calculate the Fibonacci number of n. The main method just allows the user to enter one integer value to compute the Fibonacci number of and it then displays the solution and how long the computation took in milliseconds.
